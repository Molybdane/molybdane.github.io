          <h3>The Loonie Loudmouth launches!</h>
            <article>
              Greeting readers, The Loonie Loudmouth is your source of information on what's going on in server 7, the latest server run by Loochara. The Loonie Loudmouth will operate as a news site and will refresh once or twice a week. The contents of the site will be as follows.
              <h6>Announcements:</h6>
              Here you can find information on government decisions. The Loudmouth intends to inquire the government about the latest laws put into practice to keep you informed. This is also the likely place for announcements of building projects or of changes to the Loudmouth itself.
              <h6>Articles:</h6>
              Here we intend to discuss the latest news related to products as well as providing a platform for people to help one another out. Is iron high in demand? Are upgrades available in quantity? Are more hands required on the highways? These we want to inform you about here.
              <h6>Spotlight:</h6>
              You may not know that the product you're looking for is available right around the corner! In this section, we inform you about these businesses that others overlook so that you no longer miss out on an opportunity.

          <h3>Public stamp mills</h3>
            <article>Public stamp mills are exactly what they sound like, publicly accessible stamp mills that you can drive up to have your rocks crushed. As such, they can help alleviate crushed rock shortages. They might also provide a leg up for any starting entrepeneur or aspiring miner. We at the Loudmouth know of two examples of these:</article>
          <h3>Juanrock stampmill</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/010522/spotlight01.jpg" alt="the Juanrock stamp mill";>
            <article>Just west of government store 1 at (coordinates), this stamp mill is available for 0.1 L to crush 20 rocks. The crushed stone must be picked up at the stamp mill itself, and labour must be provided. It is perfect for getting to grips with crushing smaller amounts of rock that doesn't warrant the investment of a stamp mill.</article>
          <h3>The public limestone mine stamp mill</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/010522/spotlight02.jpg" alt="the limestone mine stamp mills";>
            <article>The public limestone mine at (coordinates) south of government store 1 has 2 stamp mills available to immediately crush your earnings. The use of these stamp mills is free of charge, but labour must still be provided.</article>
          <h3>Wrapping up</h3>
            <article>Publicly accessible machinery like this might be what is necessary to get the economy back on track, either directly or by example; what other machinery can be turned into a profit in a similar manner, if labour is already provided?</article>
